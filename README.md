# Movie-Trailers
A small project from Udacity - Intro to Programming Nanodegree

ahoy there, thanks for taking the time to go through my project. 
This is my first shot at some code, so go easy on it. :)

A quick way to setup Movie Trailer Website on your machine:

1. [Clone] the latest release from GitHub.
2. There are several options to starting the website:
   * From the terminal, run `python main.py`.
   or
   * Run/build `main.py` on any Python-supported IDE.
   or
   * Open `fresh_tomatoes.html` on your browser (easiest).
3. Once the website is up, click on the image of the movie's box art to play its trailer.

## What's included
In the Movie Trailer Website directory, you'll find the following files:
```
Movie Trailer Website/
    ├──main.py
    ├──media.py
    ├──fresh_tomatoes.py
    ├──fresh_tomatoes.html
    └──README.md
```

## Requirements
* Any modern browser that supports HTML5.
* Internet access (to play trailers).
* Python 3.x if running directly from `main` script.
